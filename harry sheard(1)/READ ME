My visualisations are clearly in my folder, their module names however are Tempanonolyscomparedtoaverage.py and longtermaverage.py.
Instruction on use : To use the anomoly visulisation you must first select a country from the given list, once you have done this the program will generate a graph for you and populate the graph with the chosen data.
To use the other visulisation program it is exactly the same steps.
